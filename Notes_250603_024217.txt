Cut off from people for a few minutes in your work and isolate yourself with your Lord, and enjoy the blessings in which you worship Allah. "And tell the one who has been afflicted by the pain, he will take refuge in Allah.. God is sheltering him." - Al-Duha Gowkal, for Al-Hawqalah is followed by a miracle and a pleasure - there is no power or strength. Except with Allah (And remember your Lord when you forget) - Glory be to Allah - Alhamdulillah - Allah is the Greatest - I ask Allah's forgiveness - There is no god but Allah - There is no power or strength except with Allah - Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him - Glory be to Allah, the Great - O Allah, bless our Prophet Muhammad, there is no god but You, Glory be to You, I was one of the wrongdoers. And God would not have tormented them while you were among them, and God would not have tormented them while they were asking for forgiveness - I ask forgiveness from Allah, the Great, and I repent to Him. Whoever is called by the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: - O Allah, I seek refuge in You from helplessness and laziness, cowardice, miserliness, old age and the torment of the grave. - O Allah, give my soul piety, and purify it, you are better than purifying it, you are its guardian and its guardian. - O Allah, I seek refuge in You from knowledge that does not benefit, and from a heart that does not submit, and from a soul that is not satisfied, and from a supplication that is not answered. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you prayed to the family of Ibrahim, you are praiseworthy and glorious. Duha prayer 🖤 He, peace be upon him, said: Pray for me a lot on Friday night and Friday, for your prayers are before me - O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you prayed to the family of Ibrahim On the Ibrahim family, you are Hamid Majeed. And remember your Lord when you forget ( - Glory be to Allah - Alhamdulillah - Allah is the Greatest - I ask Allah's forgiveness - There is no god but Allah - There is no power or strength except with Allah - Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him - Glory be to Allah, the Great - May God's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammed tomorrow. And what is her preference? He said, “There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to God than these ten days.” My patience. Lord, we have left it to manage and facilitate you, and you are the best of missionaries. Lord, a heart full of your love and a soul happy with your giving. There is neither might nor power except with Allah, the Most High, the Great. The ten nights will be fixed what the days have spoiled in your heart, so get ready. Today, after Maghrib, the ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah begin, the greatest and best days in which Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, swore. With greatness, “The day of the days is more important than the night, unlike the last ten days of Ramadan.” In double, Ibn Rajab said on the authority of the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah: The booty booty is to seize the opportunity in these great days. 🍃🌸🍃 O Allah, do not leave us sadness in our hearts, but you will replace it with joy.

So, don't be surprised if you find haters who never hurt them, and you may never know them!

Sami bin Ahmed Al Jassim [5/5, 10:15 PM] null: If those around you feel that you are turning around and begging for their approval, it will make it easier for them to blackmail you. Then they will strengthen your search for acceptance, and overestimate them for the least they offer you. Here comes the role of accepting yourself and being satisfied with yourself, in order to return to the state of psychological stability that you were living in before knowing these people. Dr. Muhammad Al-Yousef [5/5, 11:15 PM] null: Some people are grumbling, disgruntled, and scornful by nature. He will not be satisfied with you or you, no matter what you give him, and even if your ten fingers light candles, he will remain demanding that he does not see that you have given him enough, and he wants you to sacrifice more. Be careful not to fall victim to such people. He considered himself a victim in this life, and he wants you to become like him and sacrifice your life with him. Dr. Muhammad Al-Yousef [6/5, 10:15 AM] null: To become the best without a doubt, you should do what others do not want to do. The majority loves rest and is lazy, wastes their time inappropriately, they talk more than they listen. They do not focus on priorities such as health, family and work. To become the best, invest your time for more strength, body strength, thought strength, family building and mastery of all your work, focusing on training and continuing education. Your weapon in all of this is to invest your time in what is useful, set priorities and apply them with discipline. The majority do not prefer it, so it will be the best, and you will reap the results faster than you think. Correct your concept of trust and do not make it dependence that leads to laziness and non-taking reasons. You will not only be the best, but you will be a role model for other relatives, colleagues and friends around you, and you will earn praise from God. Become a leader.
